Bug 1: "ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR" when running the server

- Cause: Tried accessing Djangoâ€™s development server over HTTPS, but it only supports HTTP.

- Fix: Used http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/ instead of https://.

Bug 5: "git push rejected" due to upstream issues

- Cause: The local Git branch was behind the remote repository.

- Fix: Pulled remote changes first using:
git pull origin main --rebase
