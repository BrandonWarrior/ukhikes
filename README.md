## üêõ **Bugs and Fixes**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR when Running the Server**
- **Cause**: Attempted to access Django‚Äôs development server over HTTPS, but it only supports HTTP.
- **Fix**: Used `http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/` instead of `https://`.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Git Push Rejected Due to Upstream Issues**
- **Cause**: The local Git branch was behind the remote repository.
- **Fix**:
  - Pulled remote changes first using:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main --rebase
    ```
  - Then retried the push:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Login Page Displaying "Register" Instead of "Login"**
- **Cause**: Incorrectly named template file or incorrect context variable.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `login.html` template to correctly display "Login" instead of "Register."
  - Ensured the title block was set properly:
    ```html
    {% block title %}Login{% endblock %}
    ```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Unable to Login Using Email Instead of Username**
- **Cause**: Django-allauth defaulted to username-based authentication.
- **Fix**:
  - Enabled email-based login in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = "email"
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
    ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False
    ```

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Register Page Only Showing Footer**
- **Cause**: Missing `{% block content %}` in `register.html`, preventing the form from rendering.
- **Fix**:
  - Wrapped the content inside `{% block content %}` in `register.html`:
    ```html
    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block content %}
    <h2>Register</h2>
    <form method="POST">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>
    {% endblock %}
    ```

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ `TemplateDoesNotExist: base.html` Error**
- **Cause**: Django couldn‚Äôt find `base.html` because it was placed in the wrong directory.
- **Fix**:
  - Moved `base.html` to the global `/templates/` directory.
  - Updated `settings.py` to reference the correct template path:
    ```python
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        },
    ]
    ```

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Database Migration Issues on Heroku**
- **Cause**: Missing migrations or SQLite database incompatibility with Heroku.
- **Fix**:
  - Deleted and recreated migrations:
    ```bash
    rm -rf blog/migrations
    python manage.py makemigrations blog
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
  - Switched to PostgreSQL for production:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.config(default=os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
    ```

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Environment (`env/`) Accidentally Tracked in Git**
- **Cause**: The virtual environment was committed to Git, causing conflicts during deployment.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `env/` to `.gitignore`:
    ```bash
    echo "env/" >> .gitignore
    ```
  - Removed it from Git:
    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached env/
    ```

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Static Files Not Loading on Heroku**
- **Cause**: Static files were not properly collected and served in production.
- **Fix**:
  - Configured `STATICFILES_DIRS` and `STATIC_ROOT` in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    ```
  - Ran `collectstatic`:
    ```bash
    heroku run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

---

### **üîü CSRF and ALLOWED_HOSTS Errors on Heroku**
- **Cause**: Deployment to Heroku failed due to CSRF errors and incorrect `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `settings.py`:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["your-app-name.herokuapp.com"]
    CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com"]
    ```
